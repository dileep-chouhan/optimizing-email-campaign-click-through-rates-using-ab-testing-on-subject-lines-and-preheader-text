# Optimizing Email Campaign Click-Through Rates using A/B Testing on Subject Lines and Preheader Text

## Overview

This project analyzes the results of an A/B test conducted on email campaign subject lines and preheader text to determine the optimal combination for maximizing click-through rates (CTR).  The analysis identifies the most effective subject line and preheader text pairings, providing actionable insights for improving future email marketing campaigns and increasing lead generation.  The analysis leverages statistical methods to draw meaningful conclusions from the A/B test data.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print a summary of the A/B test results to the console, including key statistics such as click-through rates for each variation and statistical significance tests comparing the different subject line and preheader text combinations.  Additionally, the script will generate visualizations (e.g., bar charts comparing CTRs) and save them as PNG files in the project directory.  These visualizations provide a clear visual representation of the analysis findings.  The specific names of the generated plot files might vary depending on the data and the analysis performed.  For example, you might see files like `ctr_comparison.png` or similar.
